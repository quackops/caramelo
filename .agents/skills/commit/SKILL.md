# Skill: Commit Creator

## 🎯 Purpose
Turn working-tree changes into clean Conventional Commits that match the
project conventions: small and atomic, a **title only** in the common case,
and a body used *only* for breaking-change notes or co-authoring trailers.

## 📥 Arguments
All optional — derive from the diff when not given.
* **`type`** / **`scope`** / **`subject`** — the Conventional Commit pieces.

## 🗂 Pre-Execution
1. **Read the diff.** `git status --short` then `git diff` (staged + unstaged).
   The message is derived from what actually changed — never guess.
2. **Split into atomic commits.** One commit = one coherent change that builds
   and passes on its own. If the working tree mixes concerns (e.g. tokens vs.
   a component vs. its stories, or two unrelated components), stage and
   commit them separately with `git add <specific paths>` rather than
   `git add -A`. Several small commits are preferable to one mixed blob.

## 📝 Message Format

### Title (always)
```
<type>(<scope>): <imperative subject, lower-case, no trailing period>
```
* Imperative mood ("add", "migrate", "fix" — not "added"/"fixes").
* Lower-case after the colon, no full stop at the end.
* `scope` is the component directory name under `src/components/` (e.g.
  `button`, `chip`, `animal-card`), or `tokens`/`style` for `src/style.css`
  changes not scoped to one component.

### Body — avoid it
The commit is **title-only by default.** Do not write an explanatory body to
describe *what* or *why* — that reasoning belongs in `.refs/architecture.md`
(per the Operating Protocol in `AGENTS.md`), not the commit. A body is
allowed **only** for:

1. **Breaking-change notes** — a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer describing the break.
2. **Co-authoring trailers** — e.g.
   `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`

If neither applies, commit with the title alone:
```bash
git commit -m "feat(chip): add Chip component"
```

When a footer/trailer *is* needed:
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(button)!: remove the on-brand variant

BREAKING CHANGE: `variant="on-brand"` is removed; use `variant="secondary"`.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

## 🏷 Type Rules (project conventions)
* `feat` / `fix` — user-facing behaviour change (a new or fixed component).
* `chore` — token migrations, dependency bumps, tooling, **and** spec changes
  that fix a flake or reduce duplication. Use `chore(...)` here, **not**
  `test`/`perf`.
* `test` — reserved for **new** test coverage only.
* `perf` — reserved for real runtime performance improvements only.
* `docs`, `refactor`, `style`, `ci`, `build` — standard Conventional Commits
  meanings. `style` covers formatting-only changes (e.g. comment removal per
  `.refs/conventions.md`) with no behavior change.

### The `!` breaking-change marker — guard
Add `!` (e.g. `feat(x)!:`) **only for a true break.** Re-exporting a renamed or
deprecated symbol with a deprecated alias is **not** a break — no `!`, no
`BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. The `!` and the footer go together when used.

## ✅ Verification
* The staged paths are exactly the ones belonging to this commit.
* Title is Conventional-Commit-shaped; no stray body.
* `!`/`BREAKING CHANGE:` present only for genuine breaks.
* `pnpm lint:types` and `pnpm test` pass before the commit, for anything
  under `src/`.

## 📤 Expected Output
* One or more atomic commits, each title-only unless a break note or co-author
  trailer is required.

## ⚠️ Rules and Constraints
* **Never** `git add -A` blindly when the tree mixes concerns — stage per
  commit.
* **Never** add a body just to explain the change — that's `.refs/`'s job.
* Commit text is written normally (full prose), even when the chat is terse.
* Don't push here.
